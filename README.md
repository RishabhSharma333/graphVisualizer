# Graph & Recursion Visualizer

This is a Single page Web App to show graph in visual format to when a input(graph) is taken .

1-> Binary Heap
    It takes a array as input and makes a heap representation of it and then converts it into a Max heap or Min heap as selected by user.
    Appropriate messages are shown while swapping and different colors are used for changed and unchanged part of array.

2->Graph Path Detection 
    It shows a graph representation of an input graph .
    It supports two input formats - Adjacency List,Edge List,Weighted Edge List.
    Finally it shows all the nodes in a dropdown menu and then finds if a path exists between start and end nodes.

3->Graph Algos
    It also supports three input format.
    It has two Traversal Algorithms -Breadth First Traversal and Depth First Traversal.
    It shows visited and unvisited nodes(using different colors) according to traversal algorithms.
    
4->Recursion
    It shows graphical dependency of different recursion problems.
    It supports Six recusion problems Fibonacci, Fast Exponentiation, Knapsack , Subset Sum,Factorial,Coin Change.
    Input the required values and then It makes all nodes according to call made.
