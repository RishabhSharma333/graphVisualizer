# Graph & Recursion Visualizer

This is a Single page Web App to show graph in visual format to when a input(graph) is taken. Checkout the demo of the project at - https://rishabhsharma333.github.io/graphVisualizer/

## Binary Heap

  It takes a array as input and makes a heap representation of it and then converts it into a Max heap or Min heap as selected by user.<br>
  Appropriate messages are shown while swapping and different colors are used for changed and unchanged part of array.<br>

## Graph Path Detection 

   It shows a graph representation of an input graph .<br>
   It supports two input formats - Adjacency List,Edge List,Weighted Edge List.<br>
   ### Adjacency List ![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/GraphVisualizationAdjList.gif)
   ### Edge List![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/graphVisualizationEdgelist.gif)
   Finally it shows all the nodes in a dropdown menu and then finds if a path exists between start and end nodes.<br>

## Graph Algos

   It also supports three input format.<br>
   It has two Traversal Algorithms -Breadth First Traversal and Depth First Traversal.<br>
   Both Algorithms is shown ![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/gifForAlgos.gif)<br>
   It shows visited and unvisited nodes(using different colors) according to traversal algorithms.<br>
    
## Recursion

   It shows graphical dependency of different recursion problems.<br>
   It supports Six recusion problems Fibonacci, Fast Exponentiation, Knapsack , Subset Sum,Factorial,Coin Change.<br>
   Input the required values and then It makes all nodes according to call made.<br>
   ### Fibonacci<br> ![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/fibonacci.gif)<br>
   ### Knapsack<br> ![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/knapsack.gif)<br>
   ### Fast Exponentiation<br> ![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/exponentiation.gif)<br>
   ### Subset Sum <br>![alt text](https://github.com/RishabhSharma333/graphVisualizer/blob/master/src/gifs/subsetSum.gif)<br>
    


##
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
